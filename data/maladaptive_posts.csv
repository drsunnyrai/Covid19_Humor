The family checked in with him virtually several times a week, and Billy's mother coached him on what to say during these video visits: ""How are you? Get well soon! We love you!""

Finally a day came when the family learned that grandfather had taken a turn for the worse and would have to go on a ventilator. He would of course be unable to talk after that. Billy's mother gave him instructions.

""Now Billy, grandfather is very sick now. The doctors will have to work very hard to help him. We have to give grandfather encouragement. So when you speak to him today, say ""I hope they pull you through.""

So they logged in for the visit. Grandfather came on the screen, and Billy's mother nudged him to speak.

""Hello, how are you?""

The grandfather, pale and thin, answered in a thin raspy voice. ""I'm at death's door.""

271,"A man and a Dog, and the extremely unusual funeral.... A man and his wife are walking down the town main street. They are arguing, as they always do, about the efficiency of wearing masks during the pandemic.

However, they have to stop because of a funeral procession that is actively going on. The procession was extremely unusual... Everyone is walking, the first family are carrying a very nice mahogany wood casket, then about 10 yards behind there is a second group carrying a second wooden casket, cheaper wood this time, but it's two caskets there... after the second casket a solitary, sad man is walking with his dog.

However, after the man there are about 500 people, oddly all walking in a straight line right behind the man...

The man who was arguing with his wife, stops arguing and decides to approach the man, with a lot of respect he decides to ask about this very unusual funeral... so he approaches the man with the lovely looking dog.

Man: Excuse me, I know this is not best moment to ask, but I have never seen a funeral like this... who is this funeral for?

Man with Dog: I understand, well my wife is in the first casket...

Man: So sorry to hear, may I ask what happened to her?

Man with Dog: My dog attacked her, and killed her.

\*they both keep walking a bit, but the man asks...

Man: So who is in the second casket?

Man with Dog: My mother in law....

Man: Oh Wow... I am so Sorry to hear... What happened to her?

486,"Why is the oil price falling to below zero?. Imagine the following...you pay $500 today and commit to receiving an escort at your house in 15 days.
Cos your wife is traveling.
This is called a futures contract. 

Unfortunately, lockdown came and your wife will be home for the next 60 days. 

You do not want this woman to show up at your house at all and try to pass this futures contract to someone else. 

Only you cannot sell this commitment because nobody can receive the escort at home anymore.

Everyone is in full storage (their balls) with wife. 

To make matters worse, not even the pimp (Chicago Mercantile exchange) has more room to receive girls because his house is crowded with girls.

All the hotels (storage tanks in other countries) are also not taking bookings and you can't send her to a hotel.

So you will pay anyone just to take the girl off your hands. 

Do you now understand why oil has a negative price when the contract is delivered?",0

A veterinary epidemiologist examined the remains of all the crows, and, to everyone's relief, confirmed the problem was NOT Coronavirus, but rather from vehicular impacts. 

Further analysis revealed that varying colors of paints appeared on the bird's beaks and claws. By analyzing these paint residues it was found that 98% of the crows had been killed by impact with motorcycles, while only 2% were killed by cars.

An Ornithological Behaviorist was called in to determine the cause for the disproportionate percentages of motorcycle kills versus car kills. He concluded that when crows eat road kill, they always have a look-out crow to warn of danger.
