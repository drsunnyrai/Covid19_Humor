756,"USA, Malaysia, Liberia, and Chile walk into a bar ????????????????. They all started pointing fingers at each other for stealing one another's flag design.

They eventually all settled down for a drink and looked towards their commonalities, particular in terms of the design of their flags.

""Better red than dead,"" said the US, as all other nations blushed with pride and remembered their movements for independence. They could have never existed and have been functionally dead and dependent on colonizers but here they were, independent nations with their own flags with hues of red. 

""Feeling blue is better than having no loo,"" said Malaysia, looking at the current lockdowns and economic downturns in each country through a relative perspective. Everybody was feeling blue but at least they all had access to toilets in their countries for all their citizens. 

Suddenly, Liberia looked away, looking embarrassed. It appeared that Liberia was feeling blue and had no loo. 

""Not to worry,"" said Chile, ""we all have white, so our future is bright,"" causing Liberia to gain a sense of optimism over her future.

Lastly, it was Liberia's turn. ""We all have stripes but at least we don't have any dykes,"" Liberia said, with USA and Chile looking in horror at what was just stated. ""You can't say that, we're in the 21st century!"" shouted USA and Chile in unison. 

Finally, Malaysia stepped to Liberia's defense, ""We may hate dykes, but at least we're not like the third reich."" 

USA and Chile begrudgingly agreed, at least they weren't as bad as the Nazis, and ""with time, they shall develop a more politically-correct rhyme,"" they said. And all four drank and smoked to that, because if there's one thing they all had in common, is that they all had a star so why not relax and smoke a cigar?

The End."

805,"Making yachts during the coronavirus lockdown. I have a friend named Pete who makes yachts for a living. Pete was quite worried about the virus as he thought not many people would be in the market for one of his nice boats. His yachts are big, sturdy, and beautiful, but primarily they're designed for big groups of people. Who's going to want to ride a yacht during a time of social distancing? Plus these bad boys cost a pretty penny, during times of economic uncertainty it seemed unlikely people will be looking to splash out on a shiny new yacht. Then in mid-March it got even worse, they had to close his factory due to the lockdown. How on earth is he going to make money now? He has 5 kids to feed not to mention the horse farm he just invested in! Well Pete has always been a man of impeccable determination and entrepreneurial spirit, so he brought his bows, sterns, sales, helms, cleats, bliges, and hulls home with him and began working from his garage. At the beginning it was very difficult as he was used to building yachts in a team, however with some hard work and perseverance he was churning them out in no time. 1 yacht. 2 yachts. 3 yachts. Soon the word broke out and people were so inspired by his story that they started buying his boats! It started off rough but this looks like it's going to be his most profitable year ever. So when you're thinking about the doom and gloom of lockdown, just remember its not bad for everybody: my mate Pete makes yachts in his garage, and his sales went through the roof."
